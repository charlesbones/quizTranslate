# quizTranslate
python script to format the quizzes from moddle to a more readable format for translation and viceversa 

## How to use it

This script needs a parameter which is the folder where the .txt files are, for instance if all the files are in a folder named English the command should be '''python toTranslate.py English/''' . This operation will create a folder called results in the English folder with the outcome of the operation.

The same for the script '''toMoodle.py''', but it will create a folder within the target folder called 'moodle'.
